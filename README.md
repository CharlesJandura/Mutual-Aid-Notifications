## Mutual-Aid-Notifications
This program is used for Newark Mutual Aid Group in order to help people who do not have access to masks and COVID safety equipment.
It allows them to fill out a google form and be sent extra care supplies.

# Contribution
I did not write the original code, but the developer who made this was on an extended hiatus and the program broke. The program also
did not have any documentation.I was tasked with both fixing the program, and documenting/commenting for future ease of use.
The specific part I contributed was all of the comments, as well as completely rewriting the entire copyData function.

# Experience
Just to talk a little bit about the experience, I was contacted by a friend who is a part of the mutual aid group. The group
didn't have anyone they could turn to for fixing the program, so I was asked if I could help. I did no know of any JavaScript
before this, and was unsure of the libraries they might have been using. It took a little bit of reading and trying to
understand the uncommented code, but I was able to get it up and running in about 30 minutes and get it shipped out
for immediate use.
